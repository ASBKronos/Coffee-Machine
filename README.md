# Coffee-Machine
Coding a Virtual Coffee Machine for a Cafe 

As a first step we need to replicate the ability to make three hot types of flavors / beverages. So the flavors we're going to make are:
1. Espresso
2. Latte
3. Cappuccino. 

Each of them requires a different quantity of water,a different quantity of coffee and a different quantity of milk.
We will call these resources available in the program. Additionally, they also cost a different price.
We're going to be modeling all this data in our coffee machine program as well along with a report that highlights our total profits and resources remaining only which the 
administrator can view based on a certain pass-phrase.
